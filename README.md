This is a web-app game, mimicking the drawing game Exquisite Corpse. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse

Three players each draw a head, a body and some legs.  The game stitches the images together to reveal the final drawings created.

To run the tests:
`npm run test:unit`

To run the server:
